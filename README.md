# Durandal Culture Service

A simple library written in TypeScript for detecting culture specific routes as well as localization support in Durandal. This library is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
